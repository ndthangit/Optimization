Description
A fleet of K identical trucks having capacity Q need to be scheduled to delivery pepsi packages from a central depot 0 to
clients 1,2,…,n. Each client i requests d[i] packages.
The distance from location i to location j is c[i,j], 0≤i,j≤n.
A delivery solution is a set of routes: each truck is associated with a route, starting from depot,
visiting some clients and returning to the depot for deliverying requested pepsi packages such that:
Each client is visited exactly by one route
Total number of packages requested by clients of each truck cannot exceed its capacity
Goal
Find a solution having minimal total travel distance
Note that:
There might be the case that a truck does not visit any client (empty route)
The orders of clients in a route is important, e.g., routes 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 and 0 -> 3-> 2 -> 1 -> 0 are different.
Input
Line 1: n,K,Q (2≤n≤12,1≤K≤5,1≤Q≤50)
Line 2: d[1],...,d[n](1≤d[i]≤10)
Line i+3 (i=0,…,n): the i
th
 row of the distance matrix c (1≤c[i,j]≤30)
Output
Minimal total travel distance
